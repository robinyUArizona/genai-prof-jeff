        "Streamlit is a powerful framework for building interactive web applications in Python. However, as you build more dynamic and complex apps, you may encounter the need to retain information between user interactions, such as keeping track of previous inputs, storing calculations, or remembering selections. This is where Streamlit's state management becomes essential.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Streamlit, state refers to the mechanism for storing and managing data during a user's session. Without state management, each interaction (like clicking a button or changing an input) triggers the entire app to rerun, resetting any values you may want to preserve. State allows you to keep these values intact, enabling more advanced and responsive behaviors in your app.\n",
        "\n",
        "### How Streamlit Handles State\n",
        "Streamlit offers a simple way to handle state through st.session_state, a special object that persists values during a userâ€™s session. This object works like a dictionary where you can store, update, and retrieve values across different parts of your app. By using session state, you can:\n",

        "In this module, we will explore state management using a loan amortization calculator as a practical example. This app allows users to input various loan parameters, perform calculations, and store the results in session state for easy comparison. By leveraging state management, the app enables users to explore different loan scenarios without losing their previous calculations, offering a richer, more interactive experience.\n",
        "\n",
        "Before diving into the specifics of the loan calculator example, we'll first cover the basics of how to use st.session_state effectively in Streamlit applications. This foundation will provide the knowledge needed to implement more advanced features and make your apps truly dynamic.\n",
