    "# 6.4: Question Answering Over Text Documents\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an advanced technique designed to enhance the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by integrating external data into the response generation process. For RAG to be truly effective, it must operate over data that is not already present in the foundation model. This is crucial because the primary advantage of RAG lies in its ability to pull in specific, often up-to-date information that the LLM might not have been exposed to during its initial training.\n",
    "\n",
    "This feature makes RAG particularly valuable for corporate environments. Companies generate and store vast amounts of proprietary data, including internal documents, customer information, and detailed reports. This data is often unique to the organization and not part of the publicly available corpus that an LLM would be trained on. By using RAG, businesses can leverage their own data to obtain more precise and contextually relevant answers from their LLMs, thereby improving decision-making processes and operational efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate the capabilities of RAG, we will utilize a sample dataset I created, containing synthetic data of employee biographies from five fictional companies. This dataset is crafted to demonstrate how RAG can effectively retrieve and utilize specific information that a foundation model would not inherently possess. By doing so, it provides a clear example of how RAG can be applied in a real-world corporate setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of such a generated biography:\n",

    "> Elena Martinez is a seasoned Robotics Engineer at FutureTech, a leading innovator in artificial intelligence and robotics based in Silicon Valley. With a Master's degree in Mechanical Engineering from MIT and over a decade of experience, Elena has been pivotal in the development of autonomous robotic systems designed to enhance urban mobility and accessibility. Her groundbreaking work includes the creation of the first AI-powered robotic assistant that can seamlessly interact with urban environments to aid the elderly and disabled. A passionate advocate for women in STEM, Elena also leads FutureTech's outreach program, aiming to inspire the next generation of female engineers through workshops and mentorships. Her contributions have not only propelled FutureTech to new heights but have also set new standards in robotics applications for social good.\n",

    "This biography showcases the type of detailed, company-specific information that RAG can retrieve and incorporate into its responses, enhancing the relevance and accuracy of the generated content.

    "The function processes a large document by dividing it into smaller, manageable segments, known as chunks, to create embeddings for LLM retrieval in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The chunk parameter determines the maximum length of each segment, ensuring the text is broken down into parts that can be efficiently handled and analyzed by the language model. The overlap parameter specifies the number of tokens that should be repeated at the beginning of each new chunk, creating an overlap between consecutive chunks. This overlap helps maintain contextual continuity across chunks, improving the quality and accuracy of the embeddings. By systematically segmenting the document and generating embeddings for each chunk, the function enhances the language model's ability to retrieve relevant information, leading to more precise and contextually appropriate responses in the RAG framework."

    "We are processing text files that contain lists of people's biographies. These settings help manage the large text data more effectively. The chunk size of 1000 ensures that each segment of text, or chunk, contains up to 1000 tokens, making it easier for the language model to handle and generate embeddings for each part. The overlap of 200 tokens means that each new chunk will start with the last 200 tokens from the previous chunk. This overlap is crucial in maintaining the continuity of the context between chunks, which is particularly useful when dealing with biographical data where details often span across multiple chunks.\n",

    "The following code reads text content from a list of URLs, processes this content by splitting it into smaller, manageable chunks, and stores these chunks as Document objects. Initially, an empty list named documents is created to hold these Document objects. The code then iterates over each URL in the provided list, printing a message to indicate the current URL being processed. For each URL, it fetches the content using the requests.get method and checks for any HTTP errors with response.raise_for_status(). Once the content is successfully retrieved, it is split into smaller segments using the chunk_text function, which takes into account the specified chunk size and overlap to maintain contextual continuity between chunks. These chunks are then used to create Document objects, each containing a portion of the text. These Document objects are subsequently appended to the documents list, effectively organizing the large text files into smaller, retrievable segments suitable for further processing, such as generating embeddings for LLM retrieval in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)."
