      "Observation is a key skill in photography. It's about noticing the details that others might overlook - the way the light filters through the leaves, the expression on a person's face, or the patterns formed by a flock of birds in the sky.

      "Patience is often overlooked in photography, but it's crucial for capturing the perfect moment.

It's this patience that often separates a good photograph from a great one.\n",

It requires observation, understanding of light, and patience, but the rewards are well worth it.
